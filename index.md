<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Computer Science Ph.D student at [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/), working under the mentorship of Prof. [Xinya Du](https://xinyadu.github.io/index.html). My research interests focus on Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models, with an emphasis on both applications—such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agents—and efficiency techniques, including model pruning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

<!-- ## Research Interest

- **Ion-material Simulation:** SRIM, SDTrimSP, RustBCA
- **Ion Irradiation/Implantation**
- **Machine Learning:** fairness AI, penalization and augmentation methods
- **E-field controlled magnetization** VCMA, Strain-mediated ME (Magnetoelectric) Effects, Straintronic, iontronic, E-filed induced spin reorientation, SOT.
- **Micro-, Nanofabrication**
- **Neuromorphic Computing** Neuromorphic Sensing and Perception, Hybrid Computing Systems, Brain-Inspired Robotics -->
