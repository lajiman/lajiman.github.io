<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Computer Science Ph.D student at [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/), working under the mentorship of Prof. [Xinya Du](https://xinyadu.github.io/index.html). My research interests focus on Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models, with an emphasis on both applications—such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agents—and efficiency techniques, including model pruning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
